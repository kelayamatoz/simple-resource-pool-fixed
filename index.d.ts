 * A resource pool is a set of resources that are kept ready to use, rather than
 * acquired on use and released afterwards. In this context, resources can refer
 * to system resources such as file handles, which are external to a process, or
 * internal resources such as objects. A pool client requests a resource from
 * the pool and performs desired operations on/with the returned resource. When
 * the client finishes its use of the resource, it is returned to the pool
 * rather than released or lost.
